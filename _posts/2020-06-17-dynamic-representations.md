In this [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0653-3), Dr. Bassett and I review recent studies on neural representations and on networks that model neural interactions and discuss the integration of the two topics. Featured on [Medical Xpress](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-framework-dynamic-representations-networked-neural.html) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/a-radical-new-model-of-the-brain-illuminates-its-wiring/?mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired&utm_medium=social&utm_social-type=owned&utm_source=twitter).

Key points in the article:
* The brain forms representations of an ever-changing environment. The representations, therefore, are also dynamic.
* The network underlying neural representations constrains how the representations change.
* The structure of the brain is hierarchically modular. One way to study dynamic neural representations is to examine
    1. how the brain's network structure constrains how representations change within a brain region and
    2. how changes in representations of one brain region affect the changes in another region.

I hope that the framework provided in this review will guide my own thesis work, as well as provide others with a new perspective on dynamic neural representations.
