#### The premise of gamification

How do we get people do to certain "desirable" things? Well, people like to do fun things, and games are designed to be fun. So by applying game-design elements, can we make things in real life more fun, enjoyable, and motivating?

Most people are familiar with basic elements of [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification), such as points, badges, and leaderboards. But can we take the concept even further and apply it to more aspects of our lives?

#### Gamifying human capital

In real life, the ultimate resource is human capital: people building, writing, fixing, serving... To properly allocate human capital, people use money to abstract capital and ultimately productivity. Prices can distribute [information](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/12/27/the-information-theory-of-money) about capital and thus distribute money, and ultimately productivity, in a relatively efficient manner.

In games, people build, play, compete, and do things but with in-game rewards, whether that be a competitive win, leveling up, or in-game money. Plus, in the game, you’re provided with free resources that lets you build and play without worrying about paying for rent or groceries, which tends not to be an important game element.

To be economically rewarded for work in real life, you have to be pretty good at what you do. So, that’s why it can be easier to play games and be rewarded in games than it is to try to be rewarded in the real world with real money.

#### Bringing games to life

**Rewards:** To explore and experience real life in the way you explore games, you need to build a source of economic income. To do so, people can seek ways to sell the product of your work.

People call this “side-hustling”. There are businesses dedicated to helping people side-hustle. See http://sidehustleschool.com and https://sidehustlestack.co.

**UBI:** We can extend this “pretend-gaming” thought experiment to universal basic income, or UBI. The best way to motivate people to do contribute to society may be to provide them the resources for them to do things. Can you imagine a game in which if you make one fatal mistake, you can't do anything productive? Who would want to play that game? I'd give up and start a different game, if not a different account on the same game. Unfortunately, people can't "re-spawn" as a new person.
