**The premise of gamification:** Games are designed to be fun, and people like to do fun things. So, can we make things in real life more fun, enjoyable, and motivating by designing tasks like games?

**Taking things further**

Games and work
In real life, the ultimate resource is human capital: people building, writing, fixing, serving, doing... To properly allocate human capital, people use money to abstract capital and ultimately productivity. Money flows through the information network (see information theory of money), and work is allocated in a relatively efficient manner.

In games, people build, play, compete, and do things but with in-game rewards, whether that be a competitive win, leveling up, or in-game money. Plus, in the game, you’re provided with free resources that lets you build and play without worrying about paying for rent or groceries, which can take

To be economically rewarded for work in real life, you have to be pretty good at what you do. So, that’s why it can be easier to play games than to try to be rewarded in real money.

Bringing games to life

Rewards
To explore and experience real life in the way you explore games, you need to build a source of economic income. To do so, seek ways to sell the product of your work. People call this “side-hustling”. There are businesses dedicated to helping people side-hustle. See http://sidehustleschool.com and https://sidehustlestack.co.

Learning
It’d be great to gamify learning by just providing a general “challenge” or goal structure and then providing real-time rewards to motivate behaviors.

UBI
We can extend this “pretend-gaming” thought experiment to universal basic income, or UBI. The best way to motivate people to do contribute to society may be to provide them the resources for them to do things.

Virtual reality
* Encoding abstractions in objects - object-oriented rewards
* Reward is a gem -> collect the gems
